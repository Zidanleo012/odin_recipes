    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 very ripe plaintains</li>
        <li>40 gr (1/4 cup) white rice flour</li>
        <li>25 gr (3 tbs) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Ice water (cold water) as needed (about 6 tbs to 7 tbs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat enough oil in a pot for deep frying, make sure there are at least 2 inches of oil, preferably 3 inches.</li>
        <li>While waiting the oil heats up, peel the bananas. Cut into 3 slices then cut each slice into 2 lengthwise slices, then cubes them. You can cut in the way whatever you like though.</li>
        <li>Whisk together all the batter ingredients in a mixing bowl. The texture should be thicker than crepes batter but thinner than pancake batter. So adjust how much water you use. Add more water if the batter seems too thick.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, coat the bananas with batter and deep-fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove bananas from the oil and drain on a wire rack to remove excess oil. This fried banana is best when served immediately or if there is some left over, you can store them in the fridge and when you want to eat them, reheat in an air fryer in 400Â°F for a few minutes until they get crispy again.</li>
    </ol>
